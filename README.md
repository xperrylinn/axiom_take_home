Please answer any or all of the following questions in Python (3.5+). You can upload a file in the "cover letter" upload section (the cover letter itself is optional). Thanks!

* Given a string representing a Roman numeral, write a function to compute the Arabic numerical equivalent. 
For example roman_to_arabic("MDCCLXXVI") should return 1776.
    * Solution: src code in solution/romain_to_integer.py with test in tests/test_roman_to_integer.py

* Write a generic function to compute various scenarios for the following optimization problem: 
A farmer owns X acres of land. She profits P1 dollars per acre of corn and P2 dollars per acre of oats. 
Her team has Y hours of labor available. The corn takes H1 hours of labor per acre and oats require H2 hours of labor per acre. How many acres of each can be planted to maximize profits?

    * Test The Function For The Following Cases

        * X = 240, Y = 320, P1 = $40, P2 = $30, H1 = 2, H2 = 1
        * X = 300, Y = 380, P1 = $70, P2 = $45, H1 = 3, H2 = 1
        * X = 180, Y = 420, P1 = $65, P2 = $55, H1 = 3, H2 = 2
       
    * Solution: src code and pronlem analysis in solution/farm_optimization.py with test in tests/test_farm_optimization.py
